#
# The soundtrack markers (#38) are the same class, and fail more quietly than #34:
# a film tag does not zero the score, it merely gets the WRONG one. The song is
# looked up under a title Last.fm does not file it by, scores a few thousand
# instead of millions, and lands in the hard/tiebreak tier — present, clipped,
# and never asked. Nothing looks broken.
#
# 'remix' is deliberately NOT here. A remix is a distinct work, not a variant:
# stripping it would score an obscure remix as the famous original and promote it
# into the pool the quiz draws from. ('mix' covers the (Extended Mix) variant case.)
